# Password-Manager

Password Manager is an application written with Python which has a Python front-end and a MySQL back-end. It is a very basic application that allows the user to view, create, add, update and delete passwords. All of this functionality is provided on the basis of a master username and password that a user has to remember and the application takes care of everything else. When adding a password for a new username, the user also has an option to enter his own password or can ask the application to generate a password for them. It can also comment on the strength of the password on the basis of number of lowercase characters, uppercase characters, special characters and numbers.
